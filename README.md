A Course Registration System for both students and faculty.


### User Stories

As any kind of user, I can:

-   [ ] login with my existing credentials

As a faculty member I can:

-   [ ] add new classes to the registration catalog
-   [ ] change the registration details for a class
-   [ ] remove a class from the registration catalog (this should unregister all registered students)

As a student, I can:

-   [ ] register a new account with the system (must be secured with a password)
-   [ ] view classes available for registration
-   [ ] register for an open and available class
-   [ ] cancel my registration for a class (if within window)
-   [ ] view the classes that I have registered for


### Need to fix:

- isFaculty header value/storing and retrieving it?
